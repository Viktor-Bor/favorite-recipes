        discription: "To make these enchiladas, we start by poaching and shredding chicken thighs for the filling; the deeper flavor of the dark meat holds up much better to the chili and tomatillo sauce than chicken breasts. We make the salsa verde by cooking tomatillos and puréeing them with chilis, onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice. You could also use already prepared bottled salsa verde. Next, we fry yellow corn tortillas to soften them and to bring out their flavor.Then it's just rolling up the tortillas with some salsa tossed shredded chicken inside and lining up the rolled tortillas in a casserole dish. Cover with salsa verde and bake! Thats it. Scatter with plenty of toppings—cotija cheese, red onion, cilantro, and sour cream to serve." },

        discription: "This is the world's best lemon drizzle cake! It's truly the zingiest, most delicious and moreish cake you’ll ever make. The recipe is easy to follow and the crumb is incredibly soft and tender. You'll make the batter in a single bowl by whisking butter and sugar together, then beat in two eggs before folding in self-raising flour. You'll then add the zest of two lemons and the juice of one to make the better super citrusy. Your mouth WILL water. You'll then pop the batter in a tin and bake! While your lemon drizzle cake is baking, you'll make an incredible syrup to drizzle over the top. It's as simple as just popping some icing sugar and lemon juice (yep, more lemon!) in a pan and briefly boiling to a thin syrup. When your cake comes out of the oven, you'll then skewer it all over and then pour on the zesty syrup. The only really difficult thing with this recipe is waiting until it's cool so that you can pop it out of the tin and devour! The sticky, zesty top is an absolute delight."},

        discription: "The marinade for chicken legs doesn't need to be complicated to produce some flavor packed results.  My marinade starts with a selection of pantry and refrigerator staples such as olive oil, soy sauce (or Worcestershire sauce is fine), brown sugar, seasonings, and lemon juice.  I simply whisk all of the ingredients up in a bowl, place the chicken legs in a large zip-top bag, then pour the marinade over the chicken. Make sure to remove any air from the plastic bag, then, massage the marinade into the chicken for a few seconds to coat.  You will want to refrigerate the chicken for as long as possible at this point.  Thirty minutes minimum is fine, but two to twelve hours is best. How long and at what temperature to bake the chicken drumsticks?  You will want to cook your drumsticks at a high temperature of 425 degrees.  Simply place them on a large, rimmed baking sheet lined with foil, then sprayed with non-stick cooking oil for easy cleanup. Then, you will cook them for 25 minutes before flipping and cooking them for an additional 10 minutes on the other side.  Flipping them once is enough, and simply ensures that they are cooked through and have a nice caramelized color on both sides."},

        discription: "Thinly slice the spring onions, reserving a handful of the sliced green parts for garnish. Peel and chop the garlic. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and cook the spring onions and garlic for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, curry powder and ground ginger and cook for 3-4 minutes. If the pan gets dry add a splash of water and make sure the spices don't burn. Add the chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Make sure all the chicken is coated and is beginning to brown on the sides. Add 250ml/9fl oz water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a medium to low heat and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through with no sign of pink juices in the middle of the pieces. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice. Pour the rice into a saucepan and rinse it under the cold tap to take away any cloudy starch. Drain the cloudy water away. Add clean water for cooking the rice. You need almost twice as much water as rice. (If you use a mug of rice, add a little less than two mugs of water). Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook very gently for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to stand with the lid on for 10 minutes. This will finish cooking the rice. Keeping the lid on is important, so none of the steam escapes. Take the curry off the heat, stir in the yoghurt then season with salt and pepper. Serve the curry with the rice and garnish with a drizzle of yoghurt."},

        discription: "Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation."},

Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer). Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed."}
